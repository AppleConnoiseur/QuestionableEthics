	<description>Organ growing, organ extraction, animal and humanoid cloning and growing in vats. And all manner of ethically questionable stuff!

If you ever thought that making human leather hats were too mundane then this mod will spice things up.

*Grow organs in vats to replace or profit from it!
*Clone and grow animals and humanoids! They take on the traits of their "parent".
*Scan brains and apply it onto your clones! Could give your colonists a sort of immortality as long as you make frequent backups.
*Enslave your enemy (or friends) through nerve stapling!
*Install crude bionics and integrated weaponry that would make even the Strogg envious!

Supports Alien Races out of the box.
