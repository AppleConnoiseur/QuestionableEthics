	<description>Contains organ growing, organ extraction, animal/humanoid cloning, brain reprogramming... and all manner of ethically questionable stuff!

If you think that making human leather hats is too mundane, then this mod will spice things up.

*Grow organs in vats to replace or profit from it!
*Clone and grow animals and humanoids! They take on the traits of their "parent".
*Scan brains and apply it onto your clones! Could give your colonists a sort of immortality as long as you make frequent backups.
*Enslave your enemy (or friends) through nerve stapling!

Supports Alien Races out of the box.
