	<description>Contains organ growing, organ extraction, animal/humanoid cloning, brain reprogramming... and all manner of ethically questionable stuff!

If you think that making human leather hats is too mundane, then this mod will spice things up.

* &lt;b&gt;Grow organs&lt;/b&gt; in vats!
* &lt;b&gt;Clone&lt;/b&gt; animals and humanoids! Clones have the traits and passions of their "parent".
* &lt;b&gt;Scan brains&lt;/b&gt; to preserve the skill levels of a pawn! Apply any brain template to your clones, to get them up-to-speed fast.
* &lt;b&gt;Recruit&lt;/b&gt; hostile pawns instantly with nerve stapling!
* &lt;b&gt;Balance&lt;/b&gt; the mod as you wish, with the Mod Settings menu
* &lt;b&gt;Enhancements&lt;/b&gt; to the original Questionable Ethics mod

Supports Alien Races out of the box. See the mod description page on Steam for more details!</description>
