# Adding QEE to a save with Questionable Ethics
**All of the steps below are purely optional**. You can absolutely load a save with QEE enabled instead of QE without doing the steps below. If you care about keeping all Questionable Ethics (QE) items or research in your colony, though, follow these steps:

1. If you have a Life Support System built or have done its research, download and enable the Life Support System mod
2. If you have Crude Bionics or Integrated Weapons built or have done their research, download and enable the Crude Bionics mod
3. Load up your save file with Questionable Ethics enabled. Make a note of these items in your save and where they are in your base:
    * Natural body parts that QE adds that are laying around. These include the Eye, Ear, Nose, Jaw, Stomach, Spine, Pelvis, Arm, Hand, Leg, and Foot
4. Exit the game and enable QEE, Life Support, and Crude Bionics. Disable QE.
5. Load up your save. You'll see many red errors. That is expected.
6. [Enable Development mode](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Testing_mods) and open the Debug Actions menu
7. Select 'Try place near thing' and replace one of the items that you recorded in Step 3 (if any). Repeat until you've replaced the missing organs.

That's it! Continue playing, and then re-save your game. You shouldn't receive those same red errors again, upon loading the save.

## Changes you might care about
* The base power cost of Clone Vats was changed from 700 > 2000 in QEE. Setup some extra power generation, if you need to!
* The Brain Scanner bill is now at the Machining Table. I moved it to keep everything at one production bench.
